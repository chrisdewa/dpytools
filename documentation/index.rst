DPYTOOLS' documentation!
====================================

dpytools is a collection of easy to use, beginner friendly but powerful, orthogonal tools to speed up discord bots
development.

This means that the library provide independent tools to ease how you write discord bots, but it won't change
how discord.py works.

The library offers more than 30 different tools at the moment, with more being frequently added.
